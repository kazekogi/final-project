        <p style="font-family: cursive;"> My name is Khang. I'm from Boston and I play a lot of World of Warcraft. Just last month, I finally got a rare item to drop in World of Warcraft that I've continously farming for the past five years. With that one of the way, I now set my sight on another grind that takes years to complete. Learning a new language.</p>

        <h2 style="font-size: 150%; font-family:cursive; text-align: center; margin: 0px;"> Why I decided to Learn Japanese</h2>
        <p style="font-family: cursive;"> I've always been an introvert my whole life. So after graduating from High School, I decided to on a trip to Japan to be more social. I made a ridiculously detailed list about the trip: which hotel to stay in, the places to visit, which night bus to take, etc... However, the virus rolled around the corner so I had to abandoned all my plans. So instead, I decided to start picking up the language in preparation for my visit to Japan.</p>

        <h2 style="font-size: 150%; font-family: cursive; text-align: center; margin: 0px;"> My Approach to Learning Japanese</h2>
        <p style="font-family: cursive"> After wasting two weeks on Duolingo and not learning anything, I decided to learn on my own. The first thing I learned was the alphabets using <a href="https://realkana.com/">this</a> website. I then picked up the "Genki I" book and started learning grammar. This was well for a while until I encountered the third Japanese writing system, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji">Kanji</a>. The book started introducing many Kanji's and I couldn't understand them. After doing some research, I picked up yet another book to help me remember the Kanji's. And so for the past 4 months, I've been going back and forth between those two books, learning new things each day. While my intial goal was to just learn a little Japanese to get by during my trip, I now want to be able to fool every Japaneses I come across to think that I'm a native speaker. </p>
